# Make a Stopwatch

Use JavaScript's timing functions `setInterval` and `setTimeout` to create a stopwatch. The stopwatch will have four capabilities:

- **In Class:**
  - a __start__ button that begins incrementing the stopwatch time. Time will be tracked in minutes, seconds, and fractional seconds to two decimal places. Example time: _4:54.05_
  - a __stop__ button that pauses the stopwatch time.
- **As Homework**
  - a __lap__ button that records the current stopwatch time into an Array. Whenever a new lap is recorded, update the DOM with a list showing all the recorded lap times.
  - a __reset__ button that immediately resets the stopwatch time to _0:00.00_ and clears all the recorded lap times.
